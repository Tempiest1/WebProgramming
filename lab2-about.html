  <h1>About Lab 2</h1>
  <p>Hello! In this lab, I am creating and adding links to web pages using HTML. I am also exploring how to structure tables, including making them accessible and easy to understand for users. In addition basic debugging techniques to help identify and fix common HTML errors.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="lab2-home.html">About</a></td>
    <td><a href="S01181453@acad.tri-c.edu">Send email to Tempiest Blake (me)</a></td>
